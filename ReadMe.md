# Project bidding application using Spring webflux and react

### Summary of requirements

### Functional Requirements
Using this application, customers can post projects with requirements including a description of the work, the number of hours expected, and the last day and time for accepting bids.
Tradespeople then bid to work on these projects using either a fixed price or hourly basis. The tradesperson with the lowest bid for the project wins when the deadline is reached.
This is an open-ended fullstack exercise. At minimum your solution should include -
1. A frontend to allow you to demonstrate your app
2. A backend which can, but not limited to:
   a. accept valid project bids from tradespeople
   b. create a job when the deadlines of the projects are reached, which will calculate and
   print the winning bid(s)
3. A data store to persist the application data

### Non Functional Requirements
● To handle 50,000 registered customers.
● On average, 100 projects are posted every day.
● On average, each project receives 50 bids.
